PhET — Organizational Information & Grant Purpose (Grant Application Case)

Organization Overview

PhET Interactive Simulations is a globally recognized education nonprofit based at the University of Colorado Boulder. PhET designs, develops, and researches interactive science and mathematics simulations that promote active, inquiry-based learning in K–12 and higher education classrooms. All PhET simulations are free, research-based, and used by millions of educators and learners worldwide.

Our work is grounded in learning sciences research. Each simulation undergoes iterative design informed by:
	•	4–6 “think-aloud” student interviews per simulation
	•	Empirical studies on how students explore, construct meaning, and apply analogies
	•	Research on conceptual understanding, classroom norms, and representational scaffolds

PhET’s design approach is summarized in peer-reviewed papers (e.g., Adams et al., 2008) and has become a model for effective STEM learning tools across the world.

Mission

PhET’s mission is to advance STEM literacy by providing free, high-quality, research-based learning tools that enable all students—regardless of background, geography, or resources—to engage deeply with core scientific and mathematical concepts.

Core Activities

PhET’s work includes:
	•	Designing new interactive simulations in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and earth science
	•	Conducting research on student learning, conceptual change, and interface design
	•	Supporting teachers through curriculum integration, workshops, and open-access teaching resources
	•	Ensuring accessibility for underserved classrooms globally

Purpose of Applying for the Grant

PhET is applying for this grant to accelerate the development, research, and classroom integration of next-generation STEM simulations, with a particular focus on improving access and engagement for underserved and under-resourced learning environments.

Specific Needs & Goals

1. Expand Research-Driven Simulation Development

To continue creating impactful tools, PhET must fund:
	•	New simulations in emerging STEM domains
	•	More student interviews and classroom studies to refine design principles
	•	Research exploring how analogy, representation, and interactivity support conceptual understanding

This grant would directly support new content creation and the research pipeline that makes PhET’s tools uniquely effective.

⸻

2. Improve Equitable Access to High-Quality STEM Resources

Many classrooms—especially those in low-income districts—lack lab equipment or updated curricula. PhET simulations can fill that gap at zero cost to teachers and students. Funding would support:
	•	Localization and translation
	•	Teacher-facing resources
	•	Accessibility enhancements (screen readers, input alternatives)

⸻

3. Integrate Simulations into Homework and Remote Learning

Research shows students rarely explore simulations independently unless homework or grade motivation is present. We aim to:
	•	Build homework systems and structured learning pathways
	•	Integrate real-time feedback and guided inquiry
	•	Support teachers in adopting sims in blended and remote formats

This area is underfunded but critical, especially post-COVID.

⸻

4. Advance Research on Chemistry and Upper-Level STEM Simulations

PhET has recently begun studying the effectiveness of chemistry simulations. Continued progress requires:
	•	Funding for domain experts
	•	Data collection in diverse classrooms
	•	Model validation and iterative design cycles

⸻

5. Disseminate Findings and Build Educator Capacity

To scale impact, PhET must share research and best practices on integrating simulations into:
	•	Lectures
	•	Labs
	•	Classroom activities
	•	Homework

Grant support allows PhET to run PD workshops, publish open research, and create free curricular materials.
