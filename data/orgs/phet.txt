PhET — Organizational Profile

Organization Overview

PhET Interactive Simulations is a leading global education nonprofit housed at the University of Colorado Boulder.
PhET designs, develops, and researches interactive science and mathematics simulations used across K–12 and higher education. All simulations are free, research-based, and designed to promote inquiry-driven STEM learning.

PhET’s simulations reach over 100M learners annually, supporting classrooms with constrained resources by providing high-quality, zero-cost alternatives to physical labs or specialized equipment.

Research Basis

Every simulation undergoes a rigorous R&D pipeline:
	•	4–6 student think-aloud interviews per simulation
	•	Iterative prototyping informed by cognitive science
	•	Classroom-based observation cycles
	•	Studies on conceptual change, representational scaffolding, and analogical reasoning

PhET’s approach is documented in peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Adams et al., 2008) and is widely adopted as a model for effective STEM instructional design.

Program Areas / Core Activities

PhET’s organizational work falls into four major activity areas:
	1.	Simulation Design & Development
	•	Building new physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and earth science simulations
	•	Developing next-generation interactive environments (HTML5, mobile-first, accessibility-ready)
	2.	Learning Sciences Research
	•	Studying conceptual understanding, student exploration, and cognitive scaffolds
	•	Running interviews, eye-tracking, classroom pilots, and mixed-method studies
	3.	Teacher Support & Curriculum Integration
	•	Creating lesson plans, activities, and teaching guides
	•	Running professional development workshops
	•	Partnering with districts, states, and global education networks
	4.	Equity & Accessibility
	•	Localization and translation into 100+ languages
	•	Accessibility features (screen readers, alt text, keyboard navigation)
	•	Specialized support for low-bandwidth and device-limited environments

Grant Purpose Overview

PhET is seeking grant support to accelerate the creation, research, and global deployment of next-generation STEM simulations, with a strong focus on equity, access, and underserved learning environments.

The funding will support five strategic needs:

⸻

1. Expand Research-Driven Simulation Development

Need: Increased demand for new simulations in emerging STEM domains.
Funding Supports:
	•	New simulation development cycles
	•	Student interviews, classroom pilots, and UX studies
	•	Research on analogy, interactivity, and conceptual scaffolding

Impact: Ensures new STEM topics are fully research-validated before reaching classrooms.

⸻

2. Strengthen Equitable Access to STEM Tools

Need: Many low-income classrooms lack lab equipment.
Funding Supports:
	•	Localization/translation into additional languages
	•	Accessibility enhancements (screen-reader support, input alternatives)
	•	Teacher materials tailored for under-resourced districts

Impact: Increases reach and usability for students with limited resources.

⸻

3. Build Homework & Independent Learning Systems

Need: Research shows students rarely explore simulations independently without structure.
Funding Supports:
	•	Structured homework pathways
	•	Real-time feedback systems
	•	Guided inquiry overlays
	•	Tools for remote/blended learning

Impact: Extends learning beyond classroom time; crucial post-COVID.

⸻

4. Advance Chemistry & Upper-Level STEM Research

Need: Chemistry instruction is conceptually difficult; sim-based learning is promising but under-researched.
Funding Supports:
	•	Hiring/contracting domain experts
	•	Data collection in diverse classrooms
	•	Iterative model validation cycles

Impact: Builds high-quality chemistry/advanced STEM tools grounded in evidence—not intuition.

⸻

5. Disseminate Research & Build Educator Capacity

Need: Teachers need training and concrete integration strategies.
Funding Supports:
	•	PD workshops
	•	Research publications
	•	Open curricular materials
	•	Partnerships with districts and universities

Impact: Ensures that simulation-based learning translates into real classroom outcomes.

⸻

Grant Summary Statement (Final Paragraph)

PhET requests support to expand its research-based simulation development pipeline, strengthen equitable access to high-quality STEM learning tools, and accelerate the deployment of next-generation simulations for classrooms worldwide. This funding will enable PhET to reach millions of learners—particularly those in underserved or resource-limited environments—while advancing rigorous learning sciences research that underpins meaningful STEM education.
