Professor Alison Riley Miller — Organizational Profile (For Grant-Matching Test)

Organization / Individual Overview
Professor Alison Riley Miller is an Associate Professor of Education and Chair of the Education Department at Bowdoin College. She is a learning scientist whose research focuses on how students engage with scientific and engineering practices across pre-K to grade 12 learning environments. Her work bridges cognitive science, educational research, and STEM pedagogy.

Miller specializes in studying modeling, data analysis, evidence-based argumentation, visualization, and scientific reasoning. She examines how students in early elementary (including play-based contexts) and secondary classrooms build conceptual understanding through authentic scientific practices.

Mission Statement
Professor Miller’s work aims to improve STEM learning by designing evidence-based learning environments and teacher professional learning that cultivate students’ abilities to think, reason, and act like scientists and engineers. She seeks to advance equitable, meaningful STEM experiences for early learners through adolescents.

Program Areas / Core Activities

1. STEM Learning Sciences Research
- Design-based research examining how students learn scientific and engineering practices.
- Study of modeling, representation, data interpretation, and scientific argumentation.
- Research on Earth & Environmental Science learning using visualizations and models.

2. Early Childhood & Elementary Science Education
- Investigates play-based engagement with scientific practices in pre-K and early elementary classrooms.
- Leads the NSF-funded project SciEPlay, exploring transitions from preschool to kindergarten STEM learning.

3. Teacher Professional Learning & Pedagogical Design
- Designs and studies teacher professional development that supports ambitious science instruction.
- Works with preservice teachers and in-service educators to integrate modeling and data practices into STEM instruction.

4. Nature-Based Education
- Research on outdoor, place-based, and nature-integrated STEM learning environments.
- Focus on student engagement through environmental and Earth Science contexts.

Background & Experience
Before earning her Ph.D., Professor Miller taught secondary-level science for nine years. This experience deeply shapes her research focus, instructional approach, and commitment to improving STEM pedagogy for both early learners and adolescents.

She is housed in Riley House (Room 204) at Bowdoin College and can be reached at amiller2@bowdoin.edu.
