Pathways Internship Program
The Pathways Internship Program is for current students in high school, college, graduate school or a qualifying career or technical education program (which may include Registered Apprenticeship Programs , Job Corps, AmeriCorps, and Peace Corps).

Many federal agencies offer this internship program to introduce students to the agency’s work environment and help them explore possible careers in the federal government. This program is a great opportunity to get paid and gain valuable work experience while still in school. If you successfully complete the program, you may be eligible for a full-time position with the federal government after you graduate.

Your internship may be part-time or full-time.
Your internship work will relate to your academic or career goals and field of study.
Each agency that participates in this program will sign an agreement with you outlining expectations.
Who is eligible?
You must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment at least part-time in school or a qualifying career or technical educational program.
